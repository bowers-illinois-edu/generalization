Generalization and the Limits of Statistics
===========================================

# Introduction/Overview

Perhaps the most important contribution of statistics to science in the 20th century was the ability to learn about that which we do not observe. Although "statistics" as data had existed at least since 16XX (cite Stigler), the idea that knowledge of how a sample was drawn from a population might allow us to make principled statements about the unobserved population did not really become formalized and useful until 18?? or even 1923 ?? (more from Stigler). It is hard to imagine how powerful this idea must have been to social scientists --- who could never observe all of the people and could never assume that any given observed person was identical to all other people. Many of the lab sciences would not have found this idea so compelling --- after all, if, say, we discovered that one piece of steel became brittle under certain conditions in the lab, we should expect any other similar piece of steel to behave similarly in the field. But, there is some real way that the use of randomness (of samples and of treatment assignment in experiments) allowed the birth of a quantitative social science --- or at least some disciplines where what we learned with feasible collections of observations had some hope of informing us about other, more important, but infeasible observations. 

Social scientists have used these ideas perhaps more effectively than other disciplines. And the emergence and later dominance of survey research testifies to the power of these ideas. 

Of course, what early frequentist statistics of Neyman, Fisher (?earlier folks? Edgeworth?) taught us that we could learn was something very specific. Mostly we could learn how certain test statistics, like means, might vary from sample to sample, from experiment to experiment. We could also know that the average of certain kinds of summaries of samples (like means) across repeated samples would equal the true population value --- that is, we learned how to use unbiased estimates and how to characterize their variance (both with respect to a thought experiment in which many samples were drawn from the same unchanging population using the same randomized procedures). We learn about the mean of a population using the mean of a sample. We could generalize.

Of course, learning about means (or other simple summaries) of populations is not the aim of science. Rather, science aims to explain. And a simple data summary is not an explanation. [INSERT DEFINITION OF EXPLANATION] While statistics has continued to help us learn about the unobserved (most notably recently with work on causal inference and machine learning), it is not the job of statistics to teach scientists how to explain --- that is, statistics cannot teach us how to create useful scientific theory or how to interpret what a given number means in substantive terms.


Imagine a randomized experiment on a random sample of independent subjects from a well-defined population. In this we estimate an average treatment effect of 10. We know, therefore, if treatment were randomly assigned many times within our sample, that the distribution of such treatment effects would center around 10. We could even calculate the spread of this distribution. And we could say it is Normal. We would also know similar things with similar confidence regarding the population from which the sample was drawn. Yet, these confident facts (which we can only say because of the really amazing intellectual accomplishments cited above) may or may not teach us how to explain a given phenomenon, or what to expect when today's population becomes tomorrow's history, or how to apply what we have learned to new situations. 

The fact is that we learn because of observation and theory. We generalize --- that is, we use what we have learned in one situation to develop expectations about another situation --- because we have theory guiding the design, analysis, and interpretation of a study. We learn from observation about theory. So, clear studies. Careful studies. Randomized studies. Random samples. All these methods of observation help us learn about theory especially effectively. Yet, it would be a mistake to think that the average treatment effect calculated from one study necessarily changes our minds about (or bolsters our confidence in) some understanding of politics merely because the study was done well and allows us to talk about populations and samples formally and confidently. 

Imagine someone asks, "Can I generalize from this study?" The answer is another question "Do you mean, do the operating characteristics of the mean calculated in your sample help you learn about the population?"  or "Do you mean, can you learn something from this study that would help us understand other situations in other places in other times, that would help us answer other broader questions?" If the question is about statistics, the answer is simple: if you have a random sample from a well-defined population, and you know how your sample was drawn, then of course, your mean would do what we now know means do should you take many new samples from that same unchanging population.  If the question is about learning, then the answer depends.... 

## How can we learn from convenient collections of observations?

It turns out that learning from random samples is not very different from learning from convenient collections of observations [say, "samples" versus "collections" ?? or "pools" or ??] In both cases we must have clear expectations to motivate the study --- that is, if we do not have clear expectations we will not know how much we were moved or pushed by the current study. We ought to be able to say, "Past theory/understanding/explanation states that we should expect such-and-so to happen if we do this-and-that." Then, say we do this-and-that. Whether or not we have a sample or a collection, we ought to learn about whatever understanding/theory led to our expectations. And then, if we were asked to develop expectations about another situation or in response to another questions, we could say, "We did exepct such-and-so, but it didn't happen. So now we feel less confident about this expectation." (or that we feel more confident if we saw what we expected to see.) A well done study might change our feelings of confidence a lot. And a less well done study might basically confuse us. [cite Gerber and Green on Learning from Observational STudies and their Bayesian Framework]. But, a study on a collection can and will help us advance science.

## To Notice: There is no population.

"But it would be nice to generalize." First, we say, generalizing in a statistical sense is nice for describing populations with samples, not necessarily nice for learning about theory. Second, however, let us be honest with ourselves about the nature of populations: they are imaginary for social scientists. Imagine that we sampled the US population and asked them a set of questions on January 1. Then imagine that we took a new sample on January 2. Is the new sample a sample of the same population? Not exactly. The statistical idea of a population (the metaphor) is of an urn containing balls. And the idea of many samples involves, basically, that either no time passes between the samples (they all happen instantaneously) or that, because the balls are just little hard balls, we could sample repeatedly over time and each sample would tell us the same information about the population. Imagine that we took new samples of the US population on January 3,4,5,\ldots. As the sample day diverges from January 1 it becomes harder and harder to claim that our sample represents the population of January 1 (and in fact, rolling cross-section surveys are meant to track changes over the course of a campaign, so, in fact, each sample is supposed to represent the population on that day and not other days (and least not directly or simply)). Thus, generalization in a statistical sense, while possible in principle, may not be desireable from the stand point of applying what we learn from the survey of Jan 1 to other moments in time. That is, if we learned something from the survey of Jan 1, we probably would want to use that understanding (new or bolstered old) to develop expectations about the US population in other circumstances and other days. That is the source of our samples, our population, changes over time and space. Thus, to care too deeply about generalizing to a population is a recipe for despair for most social scientists.
