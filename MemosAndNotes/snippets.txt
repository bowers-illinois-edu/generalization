Scholars are naturally and understandably inclined to assume that today’s practices trump yesterday’s.  How else could it be? 
 
Disciplines do not develop in linear and rational ways, however, such that today’s practices are a combination of the best of past practices, and more.  Many factors—technological changes, real-world events, developments in related fields, and the like—mold current practices, to the point that no one could have predicted them from the perspective of earlier practice alone.  Scientific progression need not be, and rarely is, continuous, and, as a result, disciplinary researchers always risk the possibility of throwing out the proverbial baby with the bath water.

During the past 60+ years, empirical political science has undergone one notable change and is currently undergoing a second.  The first is a shift from single-country qualitative studies to studies that rely on the statistical analysis of large data sets.^[This movement was widely known as "the behavioral movement." because of its close association with studies of individual political behavior and psychology although it rapidly and simultaneously applied to large data sets documenting the behavior of countries or other units where the insights from the discipline of social psychology played a less important role.]  Motivating this shift was a desire to make general statements that apply to more than a single case.  The increasing accessibility of large-N data sets, such as the Correlates of War Studies and the various National Election Studies, combined with a growing capacity to summarize and describe relationships via statistial tools in what was then large datasets, facilitated this change.  The second change, well under way although still in progress, is the growing use of the potential outcomes framework associated with statisticians Rubin, Rosenbaum, and Holland.  Motivating this second change is a desire to estimate unbiased causal relationships.  This framework encourages researchers to use experiments or to find unique situations—quasi-experiments, in Campbell’s original words—where they can approximate a counterfactual condition in which everything except the presence of the treatment of interest is the same.  .  The frequency with which the terms "causal inference" and ”unbiased estimate” now appear in the discipline’s top journals, as opposed to even a decade ago, hints at a change in methodological thinking that rivals the rise of statistical analysis during the 1960s in response to single, qualitative case studies.
