# Why cumulate?

## We cumulate to understand

Social scientists aim to share their theories, evidence, and interpretations
because they know that they are a part of a grand collective effort to
**understand** why humans and their institutions behave as they do.
Understanding brings most humans joy and comfort (cites to psychology of
understanding and need to explain). And humans also find fulfillment in working
together. So, collective effects to understand seem worthy on the grounds that
they please both the participants and those who learn and change their mental
frameworks.

## We cumulate to act and advise

Social scientists also work to cumulate science because they want to influence
policy makers and individual people as they make decisions. We know that the
strong results of a single study may turn out to be weak results if the same
study were repeated in the same place and time (say, if two lab experiments were
run in different rooms of the same building with two samples from the same
University subject pool). We hope that presenting the results of a scientific
consensus based on many more or less coordinated studies will lead to better
policy decisions and thus human flourishing.

This paper describes some of the problems arising from our desire to advise
policy makers and influence their decisions with a scientific consensus.
