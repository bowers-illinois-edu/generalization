# More thoughts from me.

Reviews that say "Reject because cannot generalize" will not count. But reviews that explain why a given set of findings do not help us learn about important stuff is ok.

The criteria of "generalizable" is changed. To "generalize from a study" is different from forcasting or predicting to non-study populations.

No more apologies or discussing saying " This design is weak on generalizability"

# Notes

Tasha:  Early The reserach design in and of itself doesn't produce generalization.

John: generalization is an inference: What studies are better or worse for generalizability. It is theory contingent. Not statistical inference. Theory not deterministic --- then need more studies.

Jay: Henrick, Ultimatium Game across societies;

Kasper studies in Denmark.

Jeremy: Imagien a small study, in Utah? "Should this generalize in Idaho?" "generalize to what?"

Jim: Calmer's MIDI book in Japan. " A sensation that the argument applies broadly."

Garret: QJE, Hunt Alcott, Opower energy (111 RCTs). PNAS, how context dependent are your studies. Power pose.

Jay: Selection effects.... , "arbitrary domain restrictions"

Colin: predictici Nancy Cartwright, predicting beyond.., Cartwright.

Ingo: "Ecological validity" (from Morton's Book). "External Validity"
