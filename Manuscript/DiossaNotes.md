James Diossa Talk about Transporting Findings


Summary:

When it comes to studies done in other cities, what matters most is how the program performed for people similar to those in the home city. So, in the case of a 5 city study, he would want to know about the effects in the cities with populations more similar to his home city population.

Some research projects mostly inspire: for example, a report on the effect of planting street trees on people’s mood inspired him to plant trees — and he didn’t ask about effects on particular sub-populations. It seem like no concerns about heterogeneity of effects on people like those in his city versus other places. Nor RCT. An inspiring idea that seemed possible. Outcome desired: mood of the people in the ciy.

Challenges for Transportability or simple use of findings from any one or even a coordinated set of studies:

-  Not shared dag 
- Different conceptualiza ruina of same dag
- Different measurements of ame dag
- Z manipulable differently / policy provided differently or contextualiza differently given history or climate or institutions 
- Same dag but Z not manipulable
- Additional outcomes (main outcome is actually a causal driver)
- Only care about their place and time so downwroght other studies (transportability formula appreciated but not undestood as other than rough sign maybe magnitude given other differences

Example of Street Trees for Mood and Heat and Air Quality. Example of kindergarten readiness (example of providence talks replication and different modes of service provision). Example of prayer (dag too vague). 
 - evidence as just inspiring (what are big cities with staffs doing)

Based on informal conversations with mayor etc We hope more interviews more formal.





Notes:

Central Falls

Like how to best provide broadband: cell phones and cell towers, versus fiber to homes, subsidies for computers? Tech support? So many choices. How might you use research done in other cities to inform your plans for Central Falls? 

How do you think about findings from studies that are not in your city? Or findings from studies from your city done a while in the past? (Or even findings from studies done recently in your city where they were done in a pilot form?)

Imagine you have to make a decision (I don’t know, propose something to a city council or something), and you can back up your argument with results from either:

 - One large randomized study (like done in another state): like 1000 people in Dallas Texas or Hartford CT
  - A collection of smaller randomized studies (say, 5 of them): 100 people each of 5 cities.

Do you have an instinct about whether one or the other would help you make decisions / plans / proposals for Central Falls better? Any thoughts about why that would be?


Central Falls: relate to neighbors, what is like Central Falls.

Focus on Detroit. The Latino Presence. 

More specificity in impact. Demographics.  

Big Cities with a staff with like 25 people that oversee a particular topic. Might be reading papers.

US Conference of Mayors. Large cities doing research. NY City had an issue that Central Falls was trying to solve. 

President of Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns: - money, - resistance, 

Appreciate that — the prediction. The transport.

Smaller communities. They look at the bigger cities.

Funding.

Street trees. (A foundation report at the US Conference of Mayors. Air Quality and Heat, Changed the mood of people.) Parks. 1000 trees in 1 sq mile in 8 years. Could be surveys. Not RCTs for sure.
