# Why does a more precisely estimated ATE not really help policy makers?

This paper explains why even the most rigorous research studies can only have an
indirect influence on policy decisions: the current literature on
transportability of effects, and generalizability of results, helps us
understand this problem. It also recommends approaches to
coordinated studies that I think should enhance the effects of such studies on
policy making.

Coordinated studies have two main aims or more --- based in both statistical
problems and also questions of interpretation: 
 - Replicate and therefore address fundamental concerns about statistical
   inference.
 - Address issue that causal relationships are contextual: a finding in one
   place or one research team might reveal a true relationship (taht would be replicable within that
   context) but replicable nowhere else. 
 -

They are not built necessarily to address the concerns of policy makers. Which
are often implementation and cost/risk concerns.

# How can coordinated studies help improve policy decision making?

A group of policy makers must make a policy and oversee its implementation in a
given place and time.^[I'm imagining a city council or other executive group in
this paper.] This policy is a change to some process that the policy makers hope
will improve some outcomes in their jurisdiction. For example, they might hope
to improve both the mental and physical health, comfort, and neighborhood
attitudes of urban neighborhoods by planting trees along the sidewalk. Or they
might hope to improve the kindergarten readiness of low income children by
funding a program to coach families in how to talk and read with their
toddlers. Or they might make all public transit free in their city in order to
reduce inequality and improve the economy. In each case they have choices about
how to pursue these outcomes.  And they also face trade-offs across different
areas.

Studies of the effects of coaching on kindergarten readiness or trees on
attitudes should, in principle, help policy makers. Or at least, many
researchers justify their research to themselves and others on the grounds of
policy relevance. However, researchers can criticize the results of any single
study on many grounds --- if the results do not agree with the priors of some
group, they might dismiss the results if the analysis was not done in a
transparent way (for example if the analysis plan was not pre-registered or the
code and data were not made public). Or they might argue that even a $p < .01$
for a null hypothesis of no effects merely means that a given result could be a
rare event --- yes, surprising from the perspective of the null hypothesis, but
making an rare error doesn't change the cost that error on the public. If the
result arose in a study in a context very different from the given city, critics
might argue that, say, a positive result **there** ought not be used as evidence
on which to base a costly policy change **here**.

Knowing about these criticisms, but still convinced that scientific research
should play a role in policy decision making, researchers have developed a
series of responses, changes in practice. So, pre-registration and sharing of
data. Also replication. And recently also coodination --- coordinated
replication. All address the concerns above.

However these are not the only concerns of policy makers but are more likely the
concerns of other researchers. They are real. But to them should be added
implementation and risk concerns.

When I asked policy makers whether a finding from a multi-city, coordinated, study would help
decision making in their city, the 

At first glance it does not seem as though any single academic study or even a
coordinated study might help this process. For example, 

I don't think they need an estimated
average treatment effect and confidence interval from a combined analysis of
multiple coordinated studies. Nor do I think they need the same kind of
information produced via some prediction or transportability function (where the
average treatment effect in one or more studies done in other places and times
are weighted using covariate information from the given place and given time so
as to predict how the average treatment effect would be estimated if the same
experiment(s) were executed there and then.) I do think that a scientific
consensus about the "theory of change" or causal mechanisms relevant to their
decision can help them. And I also think that evidence about the different paths
in the causal graph that represents this theory helps them: this is where
coordinated experiments come in. Coordinated studies help scientists to
establish a consensus about an mechanistic explanation for an outcome of
concern.^[Ideally, scientists and policy makers care about the same outcome and
have agreed on aspects of conceptualization and measurement of it.] 

# How might a single study help the city council?

## A single study done in a different context (different in place and/or time and/or covariates)?

## A single study done in a similar context (similar in place and/or time and/or covariates)?

## A single study done in a the same context (similar in place and/or time and/or covariates)?

# How might a coordinated study help the city council?

In, so far, two discussions with policy makers, I highlighted some efforts to
coordinate studies so as to increase scientific confidence in, say, the sign and
rough magnitude of some policy intervention.


# Discussion and Additional Considerations



What else would policy makers like to know?

 - What is the evidence that the kinds of people I care about were not harmed by
   your intervention even if people benefited on average?
 - What is the evidence that the kinds of people I care about benefited from the
   intervention even if you detected no average effect?
