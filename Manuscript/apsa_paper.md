# How can coordinated studies help improve policy decision making?

A group of policy makers must make a policy and oversee its implementation in a given place and
time.^[I'm imagining a city council or other executive group in this paper.]
This policy is a change to some process that the policy makers hope will improve
some outcomes in their jurisdiction. For example, they
might hope to improve both the mental health and physical comfort of urban
neighborhoods by planting trees along the sidewalk. Or they might hope to improve the
kindergarten readiness of low income children by funding a special program to
coach families in how to talk and read with their toddlers. Or they might make
all public transit free in their city in order to reduce inequality and improve
the economy. In each case they have choices about how to pursue these outcomes.
And they also face trade-offs across different areas. How might coordinated
studies help?

When I asked policy makers whether a finding from a multi-city, coordinated, study would help
decision making in their city, the 

At first glance it does not seem as though any single academic study or even a
coordinated study might help this process. For example, 

I don't think they need an estimated
average treatment effect and confidence interval from a combined analysis of
multiple coordinated studies. Nor do I think they need the same kind of
information produced via some prediction or transportability function (where the
average treatment effect in one or more studies done in other places and times
are weighted using covariate information from the given place and given time so
as to predict how the average treatment effect would be estimated if the same
experiment(s) were executed there and then.) I do think that a scientific
consensus about the "theory of change" or causal mechanisms relevant to their
decision can help them. And I also think that evidence about the different paths
in the causal graph that represents this theory helps them: this is where
coordinated experiments come in. Coordinated studies help scientists to
establish a consensus about an mechanistic explanation for an outcome of
concern.^[Ideally, scientists and policy makers care about the same outcome and
have agreed on aspects of conceptualization and measurement of it.] 

# How might a single study help the city council?

## A single study done in a different context (different in place and/or time and/or covariates)?

## A single study done in a similar context (similar in place and/or time and/or covariates)?

## A single study done in a the same context (similar in place and/or time and/or covariates)?

# How might a coordinated study help the city council?

In, so far, two discussions with policy makers, I highlighted some efforts to
coordinate studies so as to increase scientific confidence in, say, the sign and
rough magnitude of some policy intervention.


# Discussion and Additional Considerations



What else would policy makers like to know?

 - What is the evidence that the kinds of people I care about were not harmed by
   your intervention even if people benefited on average?
 - What is the evidence that the kinds of people I care about benefited from the
   intervention even if you detected no average effect?
