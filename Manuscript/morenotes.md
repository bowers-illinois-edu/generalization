We know that coordinate studies should help speed cumulative in science. How
should they help policy makers? In this essay we explain that coordination to
serve policy decision makers should have some different attributes and confront
different challanges than coordination aiming to speed
formation of and/or solidify and/or change the scientific consensus.

We use examples from the EGAP Metaketa initiative, the planning documents and
process from The Policy Lab @ Brown Universities 5 city replication of the
Providence Talks study, and funding for remote intersessory prayer (from
Giacomini and updated from our own database searches) as exampels.

We also, for this given draft, rely on some informal interviews with local
governmental leaders such as mayors of small towns or policy staff in large
counties.
 
 - best estimate of effect of tax info door to door in Zumba Malawi is a combo of its estimate and the estimates of the other cities weighted by the covariate similarities between the cities (assuming no negative effects).  Which is like best estimate for zomba is probably zomba shrunken towards the overall (but weighted or cov adjusted)

So that is one thing: convince zomba that can improve own estimate using other info.  (What if only not 0 in zomba but 0 everywhere else? What is reversed? Etc)
