# Explanation and Generalization

Arguing for a more clear and useful way to think about learning across studies, or at least, to avoid being confused about how to think about learning from one study to another.

We compiled the pdf version of this document in the following way:

```
pandoc ExplanationAndGeneralization.md --to latex --from markdown+autolink_bare_uris+ascii_identifiers+tex_math_single_backslash --output ExplanationAndGeneralization.pdf --template bowersarticletemplate.latex --latex-engine /Library/TeX/texbin/pdflatex --filter /usr/local/bin/pandoc-crossref  --filter /usr/local/bin/pandoc-citeproc
```

We have been tending to work in Google Docs and so convert the markdown into a Google Doc.
